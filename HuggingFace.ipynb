It is a branch of artificial intelligence based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention.\\n\\nMachine learning algorithms are designed to improve automatically with experience. The process of learning begins with observations or data, such as examples, direct experience, or instruction, in order to look for patterns in data and make better decisions in the future based on the examples that we provide. The primary aim is to allow the computers to learn automatically without human intervention or assistance and adjust actions accordingly.\\n\\nMachine learning is a powerful tool that can help you make better decisions, improve customer engagement, and gain a competitive advantage. It can be used to analyze data, make predictions, and automate processes.\\n\\nTypes of Machine Learning\\n\\nMachine Learning can be broadly classified into three main categories:\\n\\n1. Supervised Learning: In this type of learning, the machine learning model is trained on a labeled dataset. Labeled data is data that has already been classified or categorized. The model uses this labeled data to learn the relationship between input data and output data, and then applies this knowledge to new, unseen data to make predictions.\\n2. Unsupervised Learning: In this type of learning, the machine learning model is trained on an unlabeled dataset. Unlabeled data is data that has not been classified or categorized. The model uses this data to find patterns and relationships on its own, without any human intervention.\\n3. Semi-supervised Learning: In this type of learning, the machine learning model is trained on a combination of labeled and unlabeled data. This approach can be useful when labeled data is scarce or expensive to obtain. The model uses the labeled data to learn the relationship between input data and output data, and then uses the unlabeled data to find patterns and relationships that can be used to make predictions on new, unseen data.\\n\\nApplications of Machine Learning\\n\\nMachine learning is used in a wide range of applications, including:\\n\\n1. Image and Speech Recognition: Machine learning models can be used to recognize images and speech. For example, facial recognition systems use machine learning to identify faces in images, and speech recognition systems use machine learning to transcribe spoken words into text.\\n2. Fraud Detection: Machine learning models can be used to detect fraudulent transactions. For'"
